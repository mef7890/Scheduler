Note: To run the code, youâ€™ll have to provide your own MySQL database URL, username, and password. You can add this information in utilities.PropertiesFileCreator which will create a project.properties file. The program will read this file to establish a database connection.

*** This is a work in progress with some bugs to fix and features to add. A more detailed README file to come. *** 

Thanks for checking out my work!
